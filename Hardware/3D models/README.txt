Regarding 3D models for nRF Quadcopter

The ducts for the propellers are modeled to fit propellers of a particular diameter (the measurement eludes me at this time), 
and the clearance between the propeller and duct wall should be as small as possible

The ducts and motor holders are modeled to be printed on a machine with some inaccuarcies, 
so the planned friction fit might not be as tight when printed on another 3D printer.
This can be fixed by either changing the 3D files themselves or adding some electrical tape around the motors.

The battery holder is supposed to attach to the pin headers under the quadcopter,
holes in the "arms" of the holder need to be drilled. Preferrably as close to 0.7 mm as possible for a tight fit.
